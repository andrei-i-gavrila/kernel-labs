Use the keylogger code sample from lab 4 and the led blinking code samples
from lab 3 to construct a module which records all key strokes in a system
and when a specific key combination is typed, turns a led on or off.

You can select any key combination you like for controlling a led, for ex.:

"start caps" and "stop caps" will turn the caps led on/off.

When a user types: "Hello I'm testing the start caps feature this is cool"
the capslock key led will be automatically be turned on.

If the user types "Hello I'm testing the start cap feature this is cool"
the capslock key led will NOT be automatically turned on.

The same applies to "stop caps".

Constraints:
    1. The keylogger / led logic should run in the background and work
    without any user interaction (no need to control leds via debugfs)
    once the module is inserted.
    2. The led start/stop logic should always be active, regardless of
    where the user types (in a web browser GUI, in a terminal, etc) as
    long as the user types the correct key combination like "start caps".
